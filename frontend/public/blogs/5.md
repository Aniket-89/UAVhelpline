# UAVs in Disaster Management

When disasters strike, time is of the essence. UAVs have emerged as vital tools for disaster response, providing real-time insights and aiding in rescue missions.

## How UAVs Are Used in Disasters
1. **Search and Rescue**: Drones equipped with thermal cameras can locate survivors in challenging terrains.
2. **Damage Assessment**: UAVs quickly survey affected areas, identifying the extent of destruction.
3. **Delivering Aid**: Inaccessible regions can receive medical supplies, food, and water via drone deliveries.

### Real-World Applications
- **Hurricane Relief**: UAVs were used during Hurricane Harvey to survey flood zones and assist in evacuations.
- **Earthquake Zones**: After earthquakes, drones mapped debris fields and located survivors.
- **Wildfires**: Thermal drones monitor fire spread, helping firefighters allocate resources effectively.

UAVs are proving invaluable in saving lives and rebuilding communities, cementing their place in disaster management.
